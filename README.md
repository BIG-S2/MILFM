# MILFM
multiple-index latent factor modeling

The aim of this package is to develop a multiple-index latent factor modeling (MILFM) framework to build an accurate 
prediction model for clinical outcomes based on a massive number of features. 
We develop a three-stage estimation procedure to build the prediction model. 
MILFM uses an independent screening method to select a set of informative features, 
which may have a complex nonlinear relationship with the outcome variables. Moreover, 
we develop a latent factor model to project all informative predictors onto a small number of local subspaces, 
which lead to a few key features that capture reliable and informative covariate information. 
Finally, we fit the regularized empirical estimate to those key features in order to accurately predict clinical outcomes.
